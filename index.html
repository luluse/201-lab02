      <p>Hello, my name is Lulu and I am from France. I have a BA in History and a Associate degree in Wine Marketing. I worked in the wine industry in Seattle for the past 3 years. During my job as a wine club manager one of my missions was to keep the website updated using Wordpress. This grew an interest in building websites on me. </p>>

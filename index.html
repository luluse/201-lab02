      <p>Hello, my name is Lulu and I am from France. I have a BA in History and a Associate degree in Wine Marketing. I worked in the wine industry in Seattle for the past 3 years. During my job as a wine club manager one of my missions was to keep the website updated using Wordpress. This grew on me an interest in building websites. I'm very excited to have enough skills to be able to build cool websites from scratch. </p>
